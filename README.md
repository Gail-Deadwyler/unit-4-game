A random number is shown on the screen at the start of the game. Each crystal image shown below is associated with a random number and this number is hidden from you. By clicking on any of the images, you add a specific amount of points to your total score. You win the game by matching your total score to the random number shown on the screen and you lose the game if your total score goes above the random number shown on the screen. The game keeps track of wins, loses and total points. After each win and lose, a new random number is shown on the screen and new random numbers are associated with each image.
